        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

        <img src="images/visual-hierarchy-1080x1920.jpg" alt="Example of a website using visual hierarchy in its design">
        <p>The principle of visual hierarchy is exemplified on this website by Dell posting at the top of the web
          page a large image of one of the newest products they are selling. Next, we can see the rest of its products
          in a smaller size. Also, if we browse through their menu, we find the most important of their products at
          the top of the list.

        <h2>Repetition</h2>

        <img src="images/repetition-1080x1920.jpg" alt="Example of a website using repetition in its design">
        <p>
          The principle of repetition is exemplified on this website by Amazon because, like with many sales websites,
          they organize their products on grids with similar characteristics like size, font types, and HTML elements
          for displaying and describing them. They usually repeat that pattern for visualizing different categories
          and also in the process of market transactions.

        <h2>White Space</h2>

        <img src="images/white-space-1080x1920.jpg" alt="Example of a website using white space in its design">
        <p>
          The principle of white space and clean design is exemplified on this website from the beginning because
          they combine a lot of white space in all the sections. They also combine different alignments for the
          images or text but achieve an excellent result in asymmetric integrations.
