    <h3>Heading Font: "Merriweather".</h3>
    <p>
      I chose this font to try a new one using google fonts. I like it because of its kerning in serif style
      and its design to create a comfortable reading experience. It's useful anywhere (even for app interfaces)
      in both digital and print media. I thought about using the Roboto font, but I changed it because in a previous
      course I experimented with some visualization problems. Optional fonts will be 'Garamond' and default 'serif'.

    <h3>Paragraph Font: "Poppins".</h3>
    <p>
      I chose Poppings to experience a new font for paragraphs. Its name first caught my attention because it
      reminded me of a movie I saw when I was younger. Then, I realized it wasn't exactly the same name, but I
      liked its line spacing and tracking in its sans serif style, which makes it comfortable for reading. Optional
      fonts will be 'Arial' and default sans-serif.
